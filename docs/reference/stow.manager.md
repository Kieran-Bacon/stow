# ![mkapi](stow.manager)

!!! Important
    All `Manager` objects express the public interface defined below, so only the `Manager` interface is listed for reference.

    You should not (and cannot) initialise this class.

    For extending the class for bespoke managers, you should import and extend either the `LocalManager` or the `RemoteManager`. Information on how to do that can be found [here](/extending).
